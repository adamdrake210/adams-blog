## CRA, Material UI, react-query, react-hook-form & Typescript

Over the past year whilst developing on several small scale React apps I have experimented with multiple libraries for the main building blocks of any FrontEnd app. For me the main blocks are these:

<ul>
<li>- Data fetching</li>
<li>- State Management - Once you have the data, managing it locally to your application and keeping it in sync with data in your database</li>
<li>- UI - Rendering data to the user in a clear and digestible manner</li>
<li>- Forms - Collecting required data from the user</li>
<li>- Static Typing - Making sure you code doesn't have type errors when working with data</li>
<li>- Development Environment - An environment that lets you develop and iterate quickly to build an MVP</li>
</ul>

Through this experimentation I have tried libraries such as Redux, RTK Query, Formik, Vite, ChakraUI and some more. All wonderful libraries and ones I use depending on the use case but not ones I will go into detail here.
